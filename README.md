# """Restaurant Review Domain - Phase 3 Week 3 Code Challenge"""

In this project, we will be delving into the realm of restaurant reviews. Within our domain, three key models take center stage: Restaurant, Review, and Customer.

For the context of this challenge, we establish the following relationships:

A Restaurant is associated with multiple Reviews.
A Customer is connected to multiple Reviews.
Each Review holds connections to both a Restaurant and a Customer.
The relationship between Restaurant and Customer is characterized as a many-to-many connection.

For a deeper understanding of this project, please refer to the additional project details.
